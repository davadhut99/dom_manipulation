1. Why do we need headers any idea?
    HTTP headers are the name or value pairs that are displayed 
    in the request and response messages of message headers for Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).

    HTTP headers can be mainly classified into two types: HTTP Request Header 
    Whenever you type a URL into the address bar and try to access it, your browser sends 
    an HTTP request to the server. The HTTP request header contains information in a text-record form, 
    which includes particulars such as the type, capabilities, and version of the browser that generates the request, 
    the operating system used by the client, the page that was requested, the various types of outputs accepted by the browser, 
    and so on. HTTP Response Header Upon receiving the request header, the Web server will send an HTTP response header back
    to the client. An HTTP response header includes information in a text-record form that a Web server transmits back to the 
    client's browser. The response header contains particulars such as the type, date, and size of the file sent back by the server,
    as well as information regarding the server.

    It has the ability to make HTTP requests from the browser and 
    handle the transformation of request and response data.
