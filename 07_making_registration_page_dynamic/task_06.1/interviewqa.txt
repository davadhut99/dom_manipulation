Que.-:  Why are promises better than callbacks? 
        They can handle multiple asynchronous operations easily 
        and provide better error handling than callbacks and events. 
        In other words also, we may say that, promises are the ideal choice for 
        handling multiple callbacks at the same time, thus avoiding the undesired callback hell situation


Que.-: Write a short answer on callback vs promises.
        A callback function is passed as an argument to another function whereas 
        Promise is something that is achieved or completed in the future. In JavaScript, 
        a promise is an object and we use the promise constructor to initialize a promise. 
        To use promise objects we take help from promise consumers that are then() method(if promise fulfilled) 
        and catch() method (if promise is rejected).
